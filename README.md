### Web, Blockchain, AI with leadership experience

"The best way to predict the future is to create it."
Building the future one line of code at a timeâ€”innovating with AI, blockchain, and full-stack solutions to grow and evolve.

#### What I Bring to the Table:

- **Web2 Wizardry:** Expertise in modern web development, crafting robust and user-centric web applications using cutting-edge technologies like React, Next.js, Angular, Vue.js, Nuxt, Node.js, Nest.js, Python, Storybook, Jest, Prisma, Postgresql, MongoDB, etc.
- **Web3 Integration:** Pioneering the integration of Web3 technologies into the traditional web, enabling new paradigms in user experiences and data ownership.
- **Blockchain Brilliance:** Proficiency in blockchain technologies such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Kadena and more. I design, develop, and audit smart contracts and build decentralized applications (DApps).
- **Interdisciplinary Insights:** Bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3, I leverage my expertise to create seamless transitions, connecting the best of both worlds.
- **Security Advocate:** A staunch advocate for security, I ensure that every line of code I write is thoroughly tested and follows the highest security standards.
